Define cloud computing.
Cloud computing is delivery of computing services over the internet.
Computing services include common IT infrastructure such as virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking. 
Cloud computing uses the internet to deliver these services, it doesn’t have to be constrained by physical infrastructure the same way that a traditional datacenter is.

Describe the shared responsibility model.
With the shared responsibility model, these responsibilities get shared between the cloud provider and the consumer. 
Physical security, power, cooling, and network connectivity are the responsibility of the cloud provider. The consumer isn’t collocated with the datacenter, 
so it wouldn’t make sense for the consumer to have any of those responsibilities.
At the same time, the consumer is responsible for the data and information stored in the cloud. 
The consumer is also responsible for access security, meaning you only give access to those who need it.

Define cloud models, including public, private, and hybrid.


Identify appropriate use cases for each cloud model.


Describe the consumption-based model.


Compare cloud pricing models.
